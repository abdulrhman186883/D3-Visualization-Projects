Task 1: Prepare your dataset (10%)
Look at the dataset and think of what you can do and what kind of information can be extracted from them
using the both visualization technique. Then you need to:
1. Load and filter your dataset to avoid cluttering the visualization space too much
2. Define 3 numerical and 1 categorical attributes from the dataset
3. Choose your color mapping
Task 2: Create label (10%)
Using the color mapping you chose previously, you need to associate the color channel with one of the
attributes you have as labels. Feel free to use any type of marks to complement your label.
Task 3: Create the scatter plot matrix for each numerical attributes pair (35%)
In a scatter plot matrix, each attribute is assigned to one column and one row of a matrix such that each cell
contains a combination of two attributes that are then depicted by a scatter plot.
Helper function to create a 3 x 3 matrix is provided (createScatterPlotMatrix ). You need to complete
the scatterPlot to show the relationship between the attribute pairwise.
