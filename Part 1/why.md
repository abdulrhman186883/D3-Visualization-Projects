# Your answer for Task 2: Why

## Q1: squirrels in different habitats such as ( trees , ground) have different fur color spread? 

Target: Visualize as we need to show the distribution of fur colors in different habitats of squirrels and represent 
the proportion of each fur color related to the habitat (land or trees) this can be done by grouped bar chart  
and 
the action : is grouping as we will group colors by each habitant type.


### Tasks:


## Q2:  define the number of repetitions of the primary and highlight fur color combination in different
        age groups of squirrels in the park and see if there is any age-specific color pattern?

Target :  will visualize the frequency of combinations between the primary and highlight within different age groups in the park.
action :  create heat map that shows how frequent the primary and highlighted fur color combination for each age of squirrels after that we can use 
          cluster of classification algorithm to identify any specific color pattern as this will allow me to visualize any difference between (juvenile vs. adult) color pattern.
