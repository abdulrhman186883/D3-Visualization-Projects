# Your answer for Task 3: How

## Q1: squirrels in different habitats such as ( trees , ground) have different fur color spread?

### Encode:
data is encoded into group bar chart each bar represent color within a habitat ground or trees and the 
height of each bar represent the frequency of squirrels with each color ( black , gray or cinnamon)


### Manipulate:
to manipulate we will count the total number of squirrels in each group and then get the percentage between different fur color
to compare between the two habitats and see if there is difference or they are equal.

### Facet:
to facet the data, we can add some other factors as if the squerrel is male or female or its age and see 
the relation between fur color and location varies accros these different subgroups or not.
  
### Reduce:
we can calculate the average of the fur color in each habitat and make summary by showing the mean and the median fur color 
in each habitat group.



## Q2:  define the number of repetitions of the primary and highlight fur color combination in different
        age groups of squirrels in the park and see if there is any age-specific color pattern?


### Encode:
the data can be encoded as a heat map table as the x axis is the age group and the y axis is the highlight fur color with the primary color and by increasing the 
frequency of both color combination between the primary and the highlight the box color tends more to red as indicator of repetitions for each
age group.


### Manipulate:
to manipulate the data we can calculate the total number of squirrels in each age group and get the fur color combination percentage
and this will be represented and then we can use statistical analysis to identify the age-specific color patterns 

### Facet:
to facet the data we can add more factors like the squirrel type male or female or its habitat location to see the age varies across different subgroups of squirrel 
as we can create additional heat map of male and female squirrel on the ground and on the tree 

### Reduce:
we can also summarize the data by calculating the average max and min of number of primary and highlighted fur color combination for each group
which will make us able to identify any age-specific color pattern, Moreover the heatmap will show the result and make it possible to identify any pattern.
