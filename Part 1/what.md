that are found in the central park and the location of their places in datailes. 

## Attribute types:

1- Unique Squirrel ID: is Premairy key ( unique id) for each squirrel found in the park 
   the id consist of ( Hectare id - shift - date - PK ) example : 37F-PM-1014-03.
the type is ( categorical ) 

2- Date : the observed date is added to the dataset to know which date exactly the squirrel 
          was found in the park. the date formate is mmddyyyy example: 10142018
